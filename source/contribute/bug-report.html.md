Plume is probably not perfect, and may contain bugs. If you see something that seems
abnormal (unexpected behavior, display issue, a grammar mistake, etc), you can report it, so that we can fix it.

## If you have a GitHub account

If the issue is about Plume itself, go on [this page](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/issues/new?assignees=&labels=C%3A+Bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).
Then, all you have to do is to fill the title and the description of your issue, and to validate.

If your issue isn't about Plume itself, find the appropriate repository [in the list](https://github.com/Plume-org), go to the "Issues"
tab, click the green "New issue" button, and describe your problem.

## If you don't have a GitHub account

If you don't have a GitHub account, and don't want to create one, you can also report your issue on Matrix.
Join the Plume room as explained in [this guide](/contribute/discussion), and send a message explaining what is wrong.
We will take of creating an issue on GitHub for you.
