If you have an idea for a new feature in Plume, we will be happy to ear what
you have to propose.

## It may need to be discussed

If your feature is controversial, or not totally clear yet, the best is to open a new issue
on [Gitea](https://git.joinplu.me/Plume/Plume/issues/new) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).
Give as much details as possible. Especially, explain which problem you are trying to solve with this new feature.

## It doesn't really need to be discussed

Then you can open on [Gitea](https://git.joinplu.me/Plume/Plume/issues/new) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/issues/new?template=feature_request.md),
if you have an account there. Just fill the information asked in the form, and click "Submit new issue".

If you don't have a Giteat nor GitHub account, you can also suggest your feature in [the Matrix room](/contribute/discussion), and we
will create the issue for you.
