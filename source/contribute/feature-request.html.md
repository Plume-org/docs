If you have an idea for a new feature in Plume, we will be happy to ear what
you have to propose.

## It may need to be discussed

If your feature is controversial, or not totally clear yet, the best is to open a new discussion
[on Loomio](https://framavox.org/g/WK40YHMA/plume). If you are not sure how to do that, we have
[a guide about it](/contribute/discussion). Give as much details as possible. Especially, explain
which problem you are trying to solve with this new feature.

## It doesn't really need to be discussed

Then you can open [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=),
if you have an account there. Just fill the information asked in the form, and click "Submit new issue".

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can also suggest your feature in [the Matrix room](/contribute/discussion), and we
will create the issue for you.
