Discussion about Plume mostly take place on two websites: Loomio (long posts, more like a forum with decision tools) and Matrix
(instant chat, more suited for support or feedback).

Most of the discussions are in English, but if you are not fluent enough, you can speak in another language your are more comfortable
with, maybe we speak it too, and even if we don't we will find ways to talk with you, don't worry!

## Joining the Matrix room

Matrix is federated chat (but it doesn't use ActivityPub ðŸ˜›). If you don't have an account yet, you
can find an instance [here](https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php) (if you don't know which one to choose, just go for matrix.org).
Once you created an account, open [this link to join `#plume:disroot.org`](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plume:disroot.org). And you are done!

This place is the best one to give feedback or to ask for help if you encounter issues while using Plume, or while contributing for example.

## Joining the Loomio

Our Loomio group is hosted [on Framavox](https://framavox.org/g/WK40YHMA/plume).
You will only be asked an email address to join it. Then, you will be able to comment
on discussion, open new topics and vote. Feel free to take part in any topic that seems interesting.

All the features that need the input from the whole community are discussed here.

## Giving us feedback

If you want to give us feedback about Plume, the best place is the Matrix room (you can do it in other places, but it is more likely to be missed).
Don't hesistate to be honest when giving us feedback, and to speak about negative points as well as positive ones. As long as you aren't rude we will
be happy to ear what you have to say about Plume.
