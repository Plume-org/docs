Discussion about Plume mostly take place on Matrix (instant chat, suited for support or feedback).

Most of the discussions are in English, but if you are not fluent enough, you can speak in another language your are more comfortable
with, maybe we speak it too, and even if we don't we will find ways to talk with you, don't worry!

## Joining the Matrix room

Matrix is federated chat (but it doesn't use ActivityPub 😛). If you don't have an account yet, you
can find an instance [here](https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php) (if you don't know which one to choose, just go for matrix.org).
Once you created an account, open [this link to join `#plume-blog:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#plume-blog:matrix.org). And you are done!

This place is the best one to give feedback or to ask for help if you encounter issues while using Plume, or while contributing for example.

## Giving us feedback

If you want to give us feedback about Plume, the best place is the Matrix room (you can do it in other places, but it is more likely to be missed).
Don't hesistate to be honest when giving us feedback, and to speak about negative points as well as positive ones. As long as you aren't rude we will
be happy to ear what you have to say about Plume.
