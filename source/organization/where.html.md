## Gitea

**[Plume on Gitea](https://git.joinplu.me/Plume)**

Gitea is the place where the code lives. The repository for Plume itself is [Plume/Plume](https://git.joinplu.me/Plume).
The source of the [documentation](https://git.joinplu.me/plume/documentation) and the [official website](https://git.joinplu.me/plume/joinplu.me)
are also hosted here.

Gitea issues are used to list accepted features that should be implemented, features that need to be discussed, or for bug reports.

## GitHub

**[Plume-org on GitHub](https://github.com/Plume-org)**

GitHub is used as a mirror of Gitea repositories.

GitHub issues are also used to list accepted features that should be implemented, features that need to be discussed, or for bug reports.

## Crowdin

**[Plume on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/plume)**

We use Crowdin to translate Plume's projects.

## Matrix

**[Main room: #plume-blog:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#plume-blog:matrix.org)**

**[Developers: #plume-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#plume-dev:matrix.org)**

Matrix is our main discussion and support channel. We also make announcements about the project here, so you can join it
to stay tuned.

We also have specialized rooms for developers and translators, that you are encouraged to join if you contribute to the project.

You can also join the Plume group, to have the ability to only show Plume rooms if you want.

## Plume

**[~PlumeDev@fediverse.blog](https://fediverse.blog/~/PlumeDev)**

This blog is the one we use to publish news about Plume. All release articles are published here, but
it can also be about technical aspects of the projects, or more general announcements.

## Liberapay

**[Plume on Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Plume)**

We use Liberapay to receive donations.

## Docker Hub

**[plume-org on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/plumeorg)**

We publish x86 docker images on Docker Hub. ARM images are hosted by [Lollipop Cloud](https://lollipopcloud.solutions).

## Joining one of these places

We will eventually ask you if you want to be added the Gitea or GitHub organization, as a Crowdin manager, to the Matrix moderators
or to the authors of *~PlumeDev@fediverse.blog*.

If you consider we should add you, you can also ask by yourselve.
