# Managing themes

At the bottom of the administration interface, you have a section to manage custom themes.
You can upload new themes from here: all you need is the CSS file of your theme.

If the theme you upload is called "main.css", it will become the new default theme.
The previous default theme will still be available under the name "original-main".

Please make sure that when you upload a dark theme, it has "dark" somewhere in its name.
Blogs may use on theme names to know if the user prefers a dark or a light theme, and adapt their
own themes accordingly.
